# BinarySearchAlgorithms
## By Michael Mathews 2025

Two different binary search algorithms I wrote in Java, they are both recursive and use a helper function to fill an array, pick a random number, and then of course there is the main search function.

This is good practice and could be done in a recursive manner as well. 

### To Run

1.) Download the files.

2.) Load them in to your favorite IDE.

3.) Run either one of the scripts('BinarySearch' or 'BinarySearchSecondAttempt') and see the results. 

4.) Disect. Practice. Repeat. Try in another language. 

5.) Enjoy.
